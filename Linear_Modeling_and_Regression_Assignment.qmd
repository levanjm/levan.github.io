## Exercises

In this assignment, you will practice determining if there is a linear relationship between two quantitative variables in various built-in datasets in R. You will calculate the correlation, create basic scatterplots using `ggplot2`, and add a linear model to the scatterplots using `geom_smooth` with the `lm` method to visualize the relationships. Each problem will involve different pairs of variables from different datasets. Provide solutions and explanations for each problem.

For each problem, answer the following:

1. Calculate the correlation between the given variables.
2. Create a scatterplot using `ggplot2`.
3. Add a linear model to the scatterplot using `geom_smooth` with the `lm` method.
4. Determine if the linear model is appropriate for the data.

### Problem 1: Iris Dataset - Sepal Length vs Petal Length

**Task:** Determine if there is a linear relationship between `Sepal.Length` and `Petal.Length` in the `iris` dataset.

**Solution and Explanation:**

```{r}
# Load ggplot2 and iris dataset
library(ggplot2)
data(iris)

# Calculate correlation
cor_sepal_petal <- cor(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length)
cor_sepal_petal

# Create scatterplot with linear model
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Sepal Length vs Petal Length with Linear Model", x = "Sepal Length", y = "Petal Length")

# Explanation:
# The correlation value indicates the strength and direction of the linear relationship between Sepal Length and Petal Length.
# The scatterplot visualizes this relationship, and the linear model (line) shows the best fit line.
